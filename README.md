## Project Description

### Objective

The aim of this project is to create a simulation of a ATM, to help me to improve my procienty with C++. The Reason for building this project is so i can practise working with pointers and by extension, memory management.

### Features

* **User Login:** When the program is loaded the user is asked to input a pin, which for this project is 1234.
* **User Friendly Command Line Interface:** When the user has logged in they will be greeted by user friendly CLI, with all the options layed out that can be inputed.
* **Balance Checking:** Once logged into the program you can access the current account balance.
* **Deposits & Withdrawals:** Another thing you can do when logged in is deposit and withdraw money however, if you try withdrawing more money then you have it won't let you.

### Technologies and Tools Used

* **Language:** C++
* **Frameworks/Librarys:** None
* **Tools:** Git, VS code, and GitHub.

### Challenges Faced

One challenge was managing pointers correctly in C++. Firstly, I struggled with dereferencing pointers to access the actual value instead of the memory address. I fixed this by swapping `&` for `*`.

Another challenge was with formatting. because unlike python where every output is on a new line, isnt the case in c++. How I fixed this was by using `\n` to create a new line at the end of the statement.

### Outcome

I successfully created a simulation of an ATM machine and improved my knowledge and abilities with c++ by using pointers, memory, and debugging.
